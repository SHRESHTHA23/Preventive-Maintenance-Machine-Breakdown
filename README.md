# Preventive-Maintenance-Machine-Breakdown

Problem Statement: In this Contest case study we work on data related to machine breakdowns to predict future occurrences and create a framework for preventive maintenance.
The above machines work on the principal of pressure at 3 points. The company wants to build a model to predict breakdown and use preventive maintenance to reduce downtime (time during which production is stopped especially during setup for an operation or when making repairs).


The dataset provided has 90000 instances of maintenance work done across 1 year across various machines.
