## Analytical solution 

#The solution will predict **which machine will break next** and propose some reasons about 
#**why these machines have different lifetimes.** A survival analysis is a good choice as we can visualise the machine's lifetime very easily. 


## Assessing Feasibility

#The business has data on each machine for the last pasts years and they are able to provide some more 
#information such as the team that used it and its provider. These information seems sufficient to start an analysis.# Data exploration

## Data quality report

#As we summarise the data, we can see that the business have used 90000 machines. 
#Machine have an average lifetime of 55 weeks, with some brand new machines and others that are running since almost two years. 
#In our dataset almost **40 % of the machines have being broken in the past two years.** 

# Survival analysis {.tabset}

#As we have seen above, all variables tell us something about when a machine will break. 
#We decide to use them all into our survival analysis model. 
#We create a model using the **gaussian method** and use directly the maintenance dataset presented above. 



## Predictions

#Using our survival analysis, we can now predict which machine will break next and therefore prioritise the maintenance on these machines to avoid the supply chain to stop. 
#We have given the classification as urgent, medium and good to machines so that the client can look and maintain the machines accordingly.

### Management

#The **second action is to show these figures to team C and provider 3 and monitor the improvement.** 
#Now the management could focus on the enhancement of the machines' lifetimes and see what are the best methods. 
#Of course we should interview the workers as we could have new insights on how we could push the lifetime of each machine further.
